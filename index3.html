            <u>7 COMMON TYPES OF DEPRESSION</u>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
        </h3>
        
            
            <p>When people use the term clinical depression, they are generally referring to major depressive disorder (MDD).
                <br>
                If a person experiences the majority of these symptoms for longer than a two-week period, they will often be diagnosed with MDD.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD)
            </h3>
            <p>Dysthymia, now known as persistent depressive disorder, refers to a type of chronic depression present for more days than not for at least two years. It can be mild or moderate.<br>People might experience brief periods of not feeling depressed, but this relief of symptoms lasts for two months or less. <br>While the symptoms are not as severe as major depressive disorder, they are pervasive and long-lasting.  
            <br>They can receive the vaccine through recommended measures like time intervals for  active and inactive vaccines.

            <h3>
                Bipolar Disorder
            </h3>
            <p>
                Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by periods of abnormally elevated mood known as mania.<br> These periods can be mild (hypomania) or they can be so extreme as to cause marked impairment with a person's life, require hospitalization, or affect a person's sense of reality. <br>The vast majority of those with bipolar disorder also have episodes of major depression.
                               
            </p>
                <h3>
                    Postpartum Depression (PPD)
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Pregnancy can bring about significant hormonal shifts that can often affect a woman's moods. <br>Depression can have its onset during pregnancy or following the birth of a child.

<br>Currently classified as depression with peripartum onset, postpartum depression (PPD) is more than that just the "baby blues.

<br>Mood changes, anxiety, irritability, and other symptoms are not uncommon after giving birth and often last up to two weeks. PPD symptoms are more severe and longer-lasting.
                
<h3>
    Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD)
</h3>
<p>
    Among the most common symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are irritability, fatigue, anxiety, moodiness, bloating, increased appetite, food cravings, aches, and breast tenderness.
   <br>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) produces similar symptoms, but those related to mood are more pronounced.
</p>
<h3>
    Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)
</h3>
<p>
    If you experience depression, sleepiness, and weight gain during the winter months but feel perfectly fine in spring, you may have a condition known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD), currently called major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern.<br>

SAD is believed to be triggered by a disturbance in the normal circadian rhythm of the body.<br>Light entering through the eyes influences this rhythm, and any seasonal variation in night/day pattern can cause a disruption leading to depression.

<br>Prevalence rates for SAD can be difficult to pinpoint because the condition often goes undiagnosed and unreported. It is more common in areas further from the equator.<br> For example, estimates suggest that SAD impacts 1% of the population of Florida; that number increases to 9% in Alaska.

<h3>
    Atypical Depression
</h3>
<p>
    Do you experience signs of depression (such as overeating, sleeping too much, or extreme sensitivity to rejection) but find yourself suddenly perking up in face of a positive event?</p>

<p>Based on these symptoms, you may be diagnosed with atypical depression (current terminology refers to this as depressive disorder with atypical features), a type of depression that doesn't follow what was thought to be the "typical" presentation of the disorder.

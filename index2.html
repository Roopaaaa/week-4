                    Depression can be more than a constant state of sadness or feeling “blue.”

                    Major depression can cause a variety of symptoms. Some affect your mood, and others affect your body. Symptoms may also be ongoing, or come and go.
                    
                    The symptoms of depression can be experienced differently among men, women, and children differently.

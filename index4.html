            What Are the Main Causes of Depression?
        </h3>
        <p>There are a number of factors that may increase the chance of depression, including the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>ABUSE-</strong>  physical, sexual, or emotional abuse can increase the vulnerability to clinical depression later in life.</li>
     <br>  <li><strong>CERTAIN MEDICATIONS-</strong> Some drugs, such as isotretinoin (used to treat acne), the antiviral drug interferon-alpha, and corticosteroids, can increase your risk of depression.</li>
      <br> <li><strong>CONFLICT-</strong> Depression in someone who has the biological vulnerability to develop depression may result from personal conflicts or disputes with family members or friends.</li>
     <br>  <li><strong>DEATH OR LOSS-</strong>Sadness or grief from the death or loss of a loved one, though natural, may increase the risk of depression.</li>
     <br>  <li><strong>GENETICS-</strong>A family history of depression may increase the risk. It's thought that depression is a complex trait, meaning that there are probably many different genes that each exert small effects, rather than a single gene that contributes to disease risk. </li>
      <br> <li><strong>SERIOUS ILLNESS-</strong> Sometimes depression co-exists with a major illness or may be triggered by another medical condition.</li>
    <li><strong>MAJOR EVENTS-</strong>Even good events such as starting a new job, graduating, or getting married can lead to depression. So can moving, losing a job or income, getting divorced, or retiring. However, the syndrome of clinical depression is never just a "normal" response to stressful life events.</li>

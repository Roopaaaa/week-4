            Ormel and colleagues (2019) begin their review by summarising the evidence that the prevalence of depression has not dropped; in fact, it might have increased. They discuss key issues with preventative strategies, outlining the limitations of current research into preventing depression. They highlight the importance of several pre-requisites they deem as essential for targeting modifiable risk factors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Preventive interventions to date are described as having “unfulfilled potential”. They present evidence of efficacy, but the effect sizes are small for targeted interventions, and even smaller for universal ones.
        </p>
       <p>
        Then we come across a further problem: for preventive strategies to have large effects, we need “strong and modifiable” determinants. This is straightforward in the analogy provided in the article: smoking and lung cancer. The authors identify broad-ranging risk factors, but even the risk factors cited as the strongest (i.e. gender, genetics or negative affect), still have far lower odds ratios than that of smoking and lung cancer (Pesch et al., 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        A further complexity is that many of the risk factors for depression (such as genetics or social inequality) appear difficult to modify. The few that are cited as modifiable include personality traits, parenting, and thinking styles, although these risk factors are arguably still far more complex and harder to change than smoking.
